    # What is Orientation?

    It's a place to share knowledge you depend on and help people who rely on it 
    the most stay connected with it.

    # How does it work? 
      
    You write articles inside Orientation. You keep those article short and 
    focus on a single topic. Once you're done, you can share an article with 
    anyone and they can subscribe to it. Whenever it changes, they'll know 
    about it. 

    # How is it better?

    First, simplicity. 

    You can create an article in plain text. If you want to add markup like 
    emphasis, links, and images, you can use Markdown and we'll help you if 
    you're not familiar with it.

    Second, freshness. 

    There are many ways to wrote documentation. The tricky part comes later,
    when you need to find the documentation and keep it up-to-date. Orientation
    decays articles that have not been updated. They first become stale, 
    prompting their authors and editors to update them. Then they become rotten, 
    signaling that their information is likely inaccurate and needs updating.

    Third, connectedness.

    When you need to look up documentation for something it's often because you 
    either can't remember it or aren't familiar with the domain. This means you 
    will not just depend on the information once, but regularly. Most 
    documentation systems are somehow based on the assumption that information 
    doesn't evolve. By subscribing to an article in Orientation, you will be 
    notified when anyone updates it. You're connected to knowledge you depend on.
